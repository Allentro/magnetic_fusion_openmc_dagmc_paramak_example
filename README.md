This example makes use of a few codes to make a 3D CAD based fusion reactor
model for use in OpenMC simulations.

The model is a 90 degree sector model with reflecting surfaces.


 - The [paramak](https://github.com/ukaea/paramak) based on CadQuery 2 and used to make the 3d models
 - Trelis / Cubit with the DAGMC plugin was used to convert the CAD model into a h5m file
 - Plotly used to make the 3D html image
 - Jupyter lab with the jupyter-cadquery addition with Python was used to make the python notebook files.
